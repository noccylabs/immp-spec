## Open Questions / To Do

 * Are we doing everything possible to ensure transport security between endpoints? Short of using threats there is nothing we can do to make sure that a message is only ready by the recipient.
 * Are we doing everything possible to ensure security for the user? Are we covering any possible exploitation paths that we are creating?
 
> ***CV*** It would make sense to include PGP/GPG-support natively in the specification as a requirements before transporting the message.
