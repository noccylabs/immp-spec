IMMP: Internet Mail and Messaging Protocol - Specification and Draft

## Abstract

The protocols that power Internet mail today are ancient, devised back in the
days long before security was a serious issue they lack in a number of aspects,
mainly transport encryption and digital signing/encryption which have been added
later as an afterthought.

This document proposes a new standard for sending and receiving e-mail on the
Internet; IMMP.
